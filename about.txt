This is the mini project designed from the knowlege of our 15 days
basic python training. I have only used the syntax and funtion I have 
learned in the 15 days trainig and designed a simple game named HANGMAN.

I have import the random module from pip to generate the random word from the 
text document letter.txt. This is user friendly and use can use it properly.

HOPE YOU WILL LIKE IT!! thankyou...
